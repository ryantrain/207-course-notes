/**
 * Exercise (Chapter 13: Refactoring Techniques) — cleaning up a long method.
 *
 * <p>This exercise works differently from most of the others: <strong>the code
 * below is already correct and {@code OrderSummaryTest} already passes.</strong>
 * Your job is not to make a red test go green — it is to improve the
 * <em>structure</em> of {@link #summarize(String, String[], double[])} without
 * changing what it does. When you are finished, every test in
 * {@code OrderSummaryTest} must <strong>still pass</strong>. That is the whole
 * point of refactoring: behaviour is preserved, design improves.
 *
 * <p>Refactorings to apply (see the {@code // TODO} markers in the body):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><em>Extract Method</em> (13.2) — the report-building block at the end is
 *       a separate job and belongs in its own method; so is the per-item line
 *       formatting.
 *   <li><em>Split Loop</em> (13.5) — one loop currently does two unrelated jobs
 *       (totalling prices and counting premium items). Split it into two loops,
 *       each doing one thing, then consider extracting each into its own method.
 *   <li><em>Slide Statements</em> (13.6) — several accumulator variables are
 *       declared far above the code that uses them. Slide each declaration down
 *       next to its first use so related code sits together.
 *   <li><em>Replace magic numbers with named constants</em> — {@code 0.13},
 *       {@code 200.0}, {@code 0.10} and {@code 100.0} appear as bare literals.
 *       Give each one a {@code private static final} constant with a name that
 *       explains it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You do not have to do this by hand: IntelliJ's automated Extract Method
 * (Ctrl+Alt+M on Windows/Linux, ⌥⌘M on macOS) will do most of the work — select
 * the statements, invoke it, and name the new method. "Introduce Constant"
 * (Ctrl+Alt+C / ⌥⌘C) handles the magic numbers.
 *
 * <p>Work in small steps and <strong>re-run the tests after every step</strong>.
 * If a step turns the tests red, undo it and try a smaller one. Edit only this
 * file — {@code OrderSummaryTest} is off limits.
 *
 * <p>Relevant reading: 13.2 Extract Method, 13.5 Split Loop, 13.6 Slide
 * Statements.

   * Builds a human-readable, multi-line summary of an order.

   * as a "premium" item.

   * @param itemNames the name of each item, in order
